# console-keyboard-basic

This is a proof of concept console-keyboard, intended to be used with a console-keyboard-multiplexer. 
The libconsolekeyboard library this keyboard needs can be found in the console-keyboard-multiplexer repo.
You can build a devuan/debian package using `debuild -us -uc -b`. On other distros, just use `make` and `make install-all`.
